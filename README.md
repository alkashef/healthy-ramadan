# A Healthy Eating Guide for Ramadan

## Introduction

[Ramadan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan) is the ninth month of the Islamic (Hijri) calendar and is observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting. The month lasts 29-30 days during which Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset. It is a dry fast: no eating or drinking.  

According to the Islamic faith, cleansing the body and the soul are among the purposes of fasting. This guide is concerned with the material (body) aspect of cleansing.

## The Problem

The following factors usually contribute to un-healthy eating and weight gain during the month of Ramadan:

- Abundance of sweets on tables
- Abundance of sugary juices on tables
- Social gatherings over meals

The problem is amplified if you are over-weight, obese, or trying to follow a healthy eating diet.

## The Opportunity

Dry fasting is an excellent opportunity to cleanse the body and lose weight. Especially if you chose to follow the Islamic faith, there is no better time than Ramadan to seize this opportunity.

Aim high, but at least, avoid any losses: weight gain and nutritional deficiencies.
